I have uploaded all the files that need to make a simple Facebook app. So you can simply download the zip file, extract it and host it locally. As an Example here are the steps to host in wamp server.

1. Download the Wamp Server and Install it to your PC. (64-bit http://www.wampserver.com/en/#wampserver-64-bits-php-5-6-25-php-7) (32-bit http://www.wampserver.com/en/#wampserver-32-bits-php-5-6-25)
2. Then Run the Wamp Server
3. Then go to the path you have installed Wamp Server and go into folder called "wamp" -> "www"
4. Create a folder in any name there.
5. Then drop all the files which you have downloaded from the github(drop the extracted files), to the created folder.
6. Then open a web browser and simply type in URL bar localhost/*created folder name in www*/
7. Now you should get the legitimate website.
